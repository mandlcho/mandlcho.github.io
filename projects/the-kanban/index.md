# the kanban

Welcome to the kanban board where I keep a running log of work-in-progress, ready-for-review efforts, and experiments that just shipped. It evolves often, so treat this like a peek into the workshop while things are still on the bench.

## current swimlanes

- **discover** — ideas that need shaping before they earn dedicated time.
- **in-flight** — active experiments, prototypes, or tools.
- **staging** — items cooling, getting docs, or awaiting a proper write-up.
- **shipping** — things that went live with notes for what’s next.

## daily pulse

I update the kanban every weekday morning and again when I wrap. If you’re curious about a card, reach out — I usually have sketches, branches, or Loom walkthroughs linked behind the scenes.
