I am Mandl Cho, a curious developer who enjoys learning in public. This blog collects notes from the projects I am tinkering with—everything from web development to automation and the occasional hardware adventure.

When I am not at the keyboard you will probably find me reading, hiking, or learning a new skill. If anything you see here resonates, feel free to reach out on [GitHub](https://github.com/mandlcho).
